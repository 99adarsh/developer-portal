## Interchain Developer Academy channels on Discord

Within the Academy Discord, you will find the following topic-specific message channels:

![Three Academy message channels](/ida-course/images/discord-ida-c5-channels.png)

* We will share regular program updates via the [**c5-announcements-and-organization**](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1165928411961757727) channel. Make sure to check it regularly.
* The [**c5-lounge**](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1165929215112261682) channel is dedicated to off-topic discussions. Introduce yourself, and feel free to relax and chat about your favorite TV shows, films, and books, share pet photos, and anything else that comes to mind.
* You should ask all content-related questions within the [**c5-support forum**](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1165929341176270888) channel. There you will find tags corresponding to the main topics covered in the Academy content. These will allow you and the support team to keep track of your queries.

In addition to the three message channels, the [**IDA-Voice**](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1113844857610449050) channel is a live audio resource for conducting real-time study groups or casual chats. It is open 24 hours per day and allows easy screen sharing to facilitate your discussions. Please use it inclusively, and give priority to study activities before casual use.

## Support Gem

The [**c5-support-forum**](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1165929341176270888) now features combination support from B9Lab's expert instructors and their **Support Gem** AI chatbot.

Support Gem is a modern AI system, but it does not function with total independence. It is designed to facilitate the Academy's support service by generating coherent responses to queries; these responses are then reviewed (and if necessary are revised) by one of our expert instructors to ensure a high standard of quality.

Support Gem is capable of responding to a wide variety of queries regarding the interchain and blockchain technology more generally. It can provide assistance with course curriculum and technical support, but it cannot respond regarding program-specific queries (for example, program scheduling or deadlines).

However, please feel free to ask any question you need to in the [**c5-support-forum**](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1165929341176270888). The human support team will be there to respond to any queries that Support Gem cannot assist with.

We hope you will find Support Gem's involvement interesting and informative!

## How to post a query or request support

When posting a question in the [**c5-support-forum**](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1165929341176270888), you need to add a title and select the tag of the topic your question is related to:

![Support-forum query example](/ida-course/images/discord-howto-supportforum2023.png)

This creates a new thread for your query, so all responses and any continuation of the discussion can be easily located and identified.

<!--
After you post your message, the Support Gem will analyze the question and potentially request additional details. It will then compose a response, which is reviewed by a member of the support team and potentially revised for improved accuracy prior to publication. Support Gem's response will note which member of the support team provided human oversight.

Before and after a query has been answered, you and other participants are free to continue to post in-thread to discuss the subject. However, Support Gem will only respond to the original post of any given thread. Members of the support team may also respond directly in the event that additional information is required.
-->

After you post your message, the support team will be notified by our chatbot, **Support Gem**. They will analyze the question and potentially request additional details, then compose a response which Support Gem posts as a reply to the original query. The reply will note which member of the support team handled the query.

Before and after a query has been answered, you and other participants are free to continue to post in-thread to discuss the subject. Members of the support team may also respond directly in the event that additional information is required - feel free to ask follow-up questions!

Alternatively, you can always begin a new thread in the [c5-support-forum](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1165929341176270888) channel that will initiate the query process from the beginning.

## Response time

We aim to answer all questions within a few hours. Our maximum response time is 24 hours. **Main support hours are between 8 am UTC and 6 pm UTC.** We do not provide support during weekends.
